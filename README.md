# Vaidyakiya Sahayaka
Vaidyakiya Sakayaka is a dedicated non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to providing free medical assistance to the general public,           especially underserved communities. The NGO bridges the gap between patients and government healthcare facilities by guiding individuals who           are unaware of available services or how to access them. Through its online platform, Vaidyakiya Sakayaka enables NGO managers to register patient           details such as illness type, diagnosis, residence, and contact information, and coordinate with government hospitals. The NGO aims to ensure that           no one is deprived of timely medical care due to lack of awareness or accessibility.
